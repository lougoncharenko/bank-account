# Project Title: Bank-Account
<br>

## About The Project
Bank-Account is a project that I created to stimulate a bank account using object-oriented concepts.
<br>
<br>


## Why did you Build this project?
I built this project for my ACS 1111 class to reinforce my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming. In the project, I create a class called Bank Account with the attributes: full name, account number and balance and methods that withdraw, deposit, get balance, add interest and print out a bank statement. I created three instances of the class Bank Account and ran all of the methods on each new instance. 
<br>


## What did You learn?
- How to initiate attributes
- How to create a class
- How to call a method.
- How to create instances.
- the importance of keywordf "self"
